### DESCRIPTION

This is a smart contract that allows the owner to set, remove or change allowances to specific accounts. 
<br>

We use some imports from the OpenZeppelin Github account with regards to contract ownership.

<br>
There are two files:
<br>
<br>



* Main.sol: with the main functionality of the contract.
* Allowance.sol: all the allowance functionality to be used from the mail.sol file.
